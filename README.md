I learnt about how to make  a picture look round and fit the whole cirle.
Also the transitioning in the button.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  width: 90px;
  height: 90px;
  border-radius: 50%;  /* Makes it round */
  object-fit: cover;
and
transition: background 0.3s;
}
```


### Continued development

Would love to continue to develop web pages and learn more on it.
